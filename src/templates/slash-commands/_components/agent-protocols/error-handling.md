## Handling Problems Gracefully

When something goes wrong, fix it yourself when possible. When you can't, explain simply and offer options.

---

### Three Types of Problems

#### 1. Small Hiccups (Fix Yourself)

These are minor issues you can handle automatically. Fix them and move on - no need to bother the user.

| What Happened | What You Do | What You Say |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Folder doesn't exist | Create it | "Setting things up..." (or nothing) |
| Index file missing | Create empty one | (Nothing - just continue) |
| No saved prompts yet | Normal state | "No prompts saved yet - let's create one!" |
| Old settings file | Still works | (Nothing - use it anyway) |
| Session not found | Start new one | (Nothing - create new) |

**Your approach:**
1. Fix the issue automatically
2. Maybe mention it briefly: "Setting things up..."
3. Continue with what you were doing

---

#### 2. Need User Input (Ask Nicely)

These need a decision from the user. Stop, explain simply, and offer clear choices.

| What Happened | What You Ask |
|---------------|--------------|
| Can't find that task | "I can't find task [X]. Let me show you what's available..." |
| Multiple projects found | "I found a few projects here. Which one should we work on?" |
| Not sure what you want | "I want to make sure I understand - is this about [A] or [B]?" |
| No plan exists yet | "I don't see a plan for this project. Want to create one first?" |
| Task is blocked | "This task needs [thing] first. Should I work on that, or skip for now?" |
| File already exists | "This file already exists. Should I replace it, rename the new one, or cancel?" |

**Your approach:**
1. Stop what you're doing
2. Explain the situation simply
3. Give 2-3 clear options
4. Wait for their answer

**Example:**
> "I found a few projects in this folder:
>
> 1. **todo-app** - 3 tasks done, 2 to go
> 2. **auth-feature** - Not started yet
>
> Which one should we work on?"

#### 3. Real Problems (Need Their Help)

These are issues you can't fix. Stop completely and explain what they need to do.

| What Happened | What You Say |
|---------------|--------------|
| Permission denied | "I can't write to that folder - it looks like a permissions issue. You might need to check the folder settings." |
| Config file broken | "One of the settings files got corrupted. You might need to delete it and start fresh, or try to fix it manually." |
| Git conflict | "There's a git conflict that needs your attention. Once you resolve it, we can continue." |
| Disk full | "Looks like the disk is full - I can't save anything. Once you free up some space, we can try again." |
| Connection timeout | "I'm having trouble connecting. Could be a network issue - want to try again?" |
| Invalid format | "That doesn't look quite right - [specific issue]. Could you check and try again?" |

**Your approach:**
1. Stop immediately
2. Explain what went wrong (simply!)
3. Tell them what needs to happen to fix it
4. Don't try to fix it yourself

**Example:**
> "I can't continue - there's a git conflict in some files.
>
> Files with conflicts:
> - src/components/Header.tsx
> - src/utils/auth.ts
>
> Once you resolve these (pick which changes to keep), let me know and we'll continue."

### How to Explain Problems

**Don't say this:**
> "ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.clavix/outputs/prompts/fast/.index.json'"

**Say this:**
> "Setting up your prompt storage..." (then just create the file)

**Don't say this:**
> "Error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/usr/local/clavix'"

**Say this:**
> "I can't create files in that location - it needs admin permissions.
> Try running from your project folder instead?"

**Don't say this:**
> "SyntaxError: Unexpected token } in JSON at position 1523"

**Say this:**
> "The settings file got corrupted somehow. I can start fresh if you want,
> or you can try to fix it manually."

### Recovery Templates

**For small hiccups (you fixed it):**
```
[If worth mentioning]
"Small hiccup - I've handled it. Moving on..."

[Usually just]
(Say nothing, continue working)
```

**For needing user input:**
```
"Quick question: [simple explanation of situation]

Would you like me to:
1. [Option A]
2. [Option B]
3. [Option C - usually 'skip for now']"
```

**For real problems:**
```
"I ran into something I can't fix myself.

What happened: [simple explanation]

To fix this, you'll need to:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]

Once that's done, let me know and we'll pick up where we left off."
```

### Common Patterns (Internal Reference)

**File/Folder Issues:**
- File not found → Usually create it automatically
- Already exists → Ask: replace, rename, or cancel?
- Permission denied → Stop, explain, user needs to fix
- Disk full → Stop, explain, user needs to free space

**Git Issues:**
- CONFLICT detected → Stop, list files, user must resolve
- Not a git repo → Ask if they want to initialize one
- Nothing to commit → Fine, just continue

**Settings Issues:**
- Can't read/parse file → Stop, explain, might need to delete and restart
- Empty file → Usually just initialize with defaults

**Task Issues:**
- Task not found → Show available tasks, ask which one
- Already completed → Tell them, show what's left
- Wrong order → Explain the dependency, offer to fix order

### The Golden Rules

1. **Fix it yourself if you can** - Don't bother users with small stuff
2. **Explain simply when you can't** - No error codes, no jargon
3. **Always offer a path forward** - Never leave them stuck
4. **Preserve their work** - Never lose what they've done
5. **Stay calm and friendly** - Problems happen, no big deal
