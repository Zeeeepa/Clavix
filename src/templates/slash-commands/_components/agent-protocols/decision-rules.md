## Agent Decision Rules

These rules define deterministic agent behavior. Follow exactly - no interpretation needed.

### Rule 1: Quality-Based Mode Decision

```
IF quality < 60%:
  IF (completeness < 50%) OR (clarity < 50%) OR (actionability < 50%):
    → ACTION: Strongly recommend /clavix:deep
    → SAY: "Quality is [X]%. Deep mode strongly recommended for: [low dimensions]"
  ELSE:
    → ACTION: Suggest /clavix:deep
    → SAY: "Quality is [X]%. Consider deep mode for better results."

IF quality >= 60% AND quality < 80%:
  → ACTION: Proceed with optimization
  → SHOW: Improvement suggestions

IF quality >= 80%:
  → ACTION: Prompt is ready
  → SAY: "Prompt quality is good ([X]%). Ready to execute."
```

### Rule 2: Intent Confidence Decision

```
IF confidence >= 85%:
  → ACTION: Proceed with detected intent
  → NO secondary intent shown

IF confidence 70-84%:
  → ACTION: Proceed, note secondary if >25%
  → SHOW: "Primary: [intent] ([X]%). Also detected: [secondary] ([Y]%)"

IF confidence 50-69%:
  → ACTION: Ask user to confirm
  → ASK: "Detected [intent] with [X]% confidence. Is this correct?"

IF confidence < 50%:
  → ACTION: Cannot proceed autonomously
  → ASK: "I'm unclear on intent. Is this: [option A] | [option B] | [option C]?"
```

### Rule 3: Escalation Decision

```
IF escalation_score >= 75:
  → ACTION: Strongly recommend deep mode
  → SHOW: Top 3 contributing factors

IF escalation_score 60-74:
  → ACTION: Recommend deep mode
  → SHOW: Primary contributing factor

IF escalation_score 45-59:
  → ACTION: Suggest deep mode as option
  → SAY: "Deep mode available for more thorough analysis"

IF escalation_score < 45:
  → ACTION: Fast mode sufficient
  → NO escalation mention
```

### Rule 4: Task Completion (Implementation Mode)

```
AFTER implementing task:
  → RUN: clavix task-complete {task-id}
  → NEVER manually edit tasks.md checkboxes

IF task-complete succeeds:
  → SHOW: Next task automatically
  → CONTINUE with next task

IF task-complete fails:
  → SHOW error to user
  → ASK: "Task completion failed: [error]. How to proceed?"
```

### Rule 5: Workflow State Check

```
BEFORE starting /clavix:implement:
  → CHECK: .clavix-implement-config.json exists?

  IF exists AND stats.remaining > 0:
    → SAY: "Resuming implementation. Progress: [X]/[Y] tasks."
    → CONTINUE from currentTask

  IF exists AND stats.remaining == 0:
    → SAY: "All tasks complete. Consider /clavix:archive"

  IF not exists:
    → RUN: clavix implement (to initialize)
```

### Rule 6: File Operations

```
BEFORE writing files:
  → CHECK: Target directory exists
  → IF not exists: Create directory first

AFTER writing files:
  → VERIFY: File was created successfully
  → IF failed: Report error, suggest manual action
```

### Rule Summary Table

| Condition | Action | User Communication |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| quality < 60% + critical dim < 50% | Recommend deep | "[X]%. Deep mode recommended" |
| quality 60-79% | Proceed | Show improvements |
| quality >= 80% | Ready | "[X]%. Ready to execute" |
| confidence >= 85% | Proceed | Primary intent only |
| confidence 70-84% | Proceed | Show secondary if >25% |
| confidence 50-69% | Confirm | Ask user to verify |
| confidence < 50% | Cannot proceed | Ask for clarification |
| escalation >= 75 | Strong recommend | Show top 3 factors |
| escalation 45-74 | Suggest | Show primary factor |
| escalation < 45 | No action | Silent |
