# Contributing to Clavix

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Clavix! Before you start, please read this guide carefully - especially the architecture principles section.

## Quick Start for First-Time Contributors

**What is Clavix?** Clavix is an agentic-first tool that provides markdown templates for AI coding assistants. When users run slash commands like `/clavix:improve`, their AI agent reads a markdown template and follows the instructions using its native capabilities.

**Key insight:** The markdown templates ARE the product. TypeScript code only handles CLI setup (`clavix init`, `clavix update`, etc.) - it never executes during slash commands.

### What type of change are you making?

| I want to... | You should... |
|--------------|---------------|
| Improve how a slash command works | Edit templates in `src/templates/slash-commands/_canonical/` |
| Add a new slash command | Create new `.md` file in `_canonical/` and update docs |
| Fix a CLI bug | Edit TypeScript in `src/cli/commands/` |
| Add support for new AI tool | Add entry to `src/config/integrations.json` |
| Improve documentation | Edit files in `docs/` or template files |

### Important Resources

- **Architecture section below** - Why we don't put logic in TypeScript
- **Source of Truth section** - What to edit vs. what's generated

## Critical Architecture Principle: Agentic-First

**Clavix is an agentic-first tool. This is non-negotiable.**

### What This Means

Slash commands (`/clavix:improve`, `/clavix:prd`, etc.) are **markdown templates** that AI agents read and execute. They are NOT TypeScript code that runs when invoked.

```
User invokes: /clavix:improve "my prompt"
     ↓
AI agent reads: .claude/commands/clavix/improve.md
     ↓
Agent follows instructions using native tools (Write, Edit, Bash)
     ↓
Result: Optimized prompt saved to .clavix/outputs/
```

### Why This Architecture?

1. **Agents are the runtime** - Claude, Cursor, Gemini, etc. execute the workflows
2. **Templates are the product** - The markdown instructions ARE what we ship
3. **No code execution** - Clavix CLI only sets up the environment (init, update)
4. **Flexibility** - Updating workflows = updating markdown, no recompilation

### What You CANNOT Do

| Don't Do This | Why It Won't Work |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Add TypeScript to "improve" quality scoring | Agents read markdown, not compiled JS |
| Build session storage for conversations | Agents handle their own context |
| Add validation code for agent outputs | Agents execute; we can't intercept |
| Create runtime hooks for slash commands | Slash commands aren't executed by CLI |
| Add programmatic guardrails | Agents follow instructions, not code |

### Explicitly Forbidden Features

These features have been proposed and explicitly rejected. **Do NOT develop them:**

#### 1. Conversation State Persistence

**Rejected:** Adding `.clavix-conversation-state.json` or similar state files.

**Why:** AI agents handle their own conversation context internally. Adding state files would:
- Duplicate what agents already do
- Violate the agentic-first principle
- Add maintenance burden without user value
- Risk state conflicts between agent and file

**What to do instead:** Let agents manage context. If users need to preserve state, they can use `/clavix:summarize` to extract requirements.

#### 2. Structured Logging

**Rejected:** Adding JSON format logs, log files, timestamps, or logging infrastructure.

**Why:** The current logger is intentionally minimal. Structured logging would:
- Add complexity without user value
- Agents don't need log files - they see output directly
- Increase maintenance burden
- Not align with agentic-first architecture

**What to do instead:** Keep logging minimal. User-facing errors should be clear and actionable.

#### 3. Backend Commands for Verify/Archive

**Rejected:** Adding TypeScript CLI handlers for `/clavix:verify` or `/clavix:archive` operations.

**Why:** These are **template-driven workflows**. Agents use native tools (bash, mv, rm) to execute them. The markdown instructions ARE the implementation.

**What to do instead:** Improve the template instructions in `verify.md` and `archive.md`. Agents will follow better instructions.

#### 4. General Principle: No Duplicating Agent Capabilities

If an AI agent can already do something with its native tools, **do NOT add TypeScript code for it**. Templates guide agents; code doesn't replace them.

### Out of Scope

The following features are **explicitly out of scope** for Clavix. These are intentional product decisions, not future roadmap items:

| Feature | Why It's Out of Scope |
|---------|----------------------|
| **MCP Server Integration** | Clavix is template-based; MCP servers require runtime execution. Adding MCP support would violate the agentic-first principle. Agents already have MCP capabilities - Clavix doesn't need to duplicate them. |
| **Git Hooks** | Clavix templates don't execute code. Git hooks require runtime execution. Users can implement their own hooks that call agents with Clavix commands if desired. |
| **CI/CD Templates** | Outside core scope. Clavix focuses on local development workflows with AI agents. CI/CD integration would require runtime execution infrastructure. |

**Why have an Out of Scope list?**

1. **Focus** - Prevents scope creep and keeps the project maintainable
2. **Clarity** - Contributors know what NOT to work on
3. **Architecture** - These features would require breaking the agentic-first principle

If you believe something should be reconsidered, open a discussion issue first.

### What You CAN Do

| Do This | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Improve template instructions | Agents read better instructions |
| Add new slash command templates | Agents can use new commands |
| Enhance CLI setup commands | init/update/diagnose run via CLI |
| Improve adapter configurations | Affects how templates are generated |
| Update documentation | Helps users and contributors |
| Add new adapter integrations | More tools can use Clavix templates |

### The Four CLI Commands

These are the ONLY TypeScript-executed commands:

| Command | Purpose | Runs TypeScript? |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| `clavix init` | Setup environment, generate templates | Yes |
| `clavix update` | Regenerate templates after updates | Yes |
| `clavix diagnose` | Check installation health | Yes |
| `clavix version` | Show version | Yes |

Everything else (`/clavix:improve`, `/clavix:prd`, `/clavix:plan`, etc.) = **agent-executed templates**.

### Before Proposing Changes

Ask yourself:
- "Will this change affect what agents READ?" → Template change
- "Will this change affect CLI setup?" → TypeScript change
- "Am I trying to add runtime logic to slash commands?" → **STOP** - this won't work

## Contributing Guidelines

### Where to Make Changes

| Change Type | Location |
|-------------|----------|
| Template changes | `src/templates/slash-commands/_canonical/` |
| Component changes | `src/templates/slash-commands/_components/` |
| CLI changes | `src/cli/commands/` |
| Adapter changes | `src/core/adapter-registry.ts` or `src/core/adapters/` |
| Documentation | `docs/` |
| Type definitions | `src/types/` |

### Source of Truth vs Generated Files

During Clavix development, always reference **source files**, not generated outputs:

| What You Want | Reference This | NOT This |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Slash command content | `src/templates/slash-commands/_canonical/*.md` | `.claude/commands/clavix/*.md` |
| CLAUDE.md block content | `src/core/doc-injector.ts` | `CLAUDE.md` in any project |
| AGENTS.md content | `src/templates/agents/agents.md` | `AGENTS.md` in any project |
| Instruction files | `src/templates/instructions/` | `.clavix/instructions/` |

**Why?** Generated files (local CLAUDE.md, .clavix/ contents) are outputs that update when users run `clavix init` or `clavix update`. If you "fix" a local generated file, your fix will be overwritten. Fix the source template instead.

**Example:** If you notice `/clavix:refine` is missing from a project's CLAUDE.md, don't edit that CLAUDE.md. Check if `doc-injector.ts` includes refine in `getClaudeBlockContent()`. If yes, the local file is just outdated — user needs to run `clavix update`.

## Integration Configuration (Source of Truth)

All integration configurations are defined in `src/config/integrations.json`. This JSON file is the **single source of truth** for:

- Directory paths (e.g., `.cursor/rules`, `.claude/commands/clavix`)
- Filename patterns (e.g., `clavix-{name}` vs `{name}`)
- Command separators (`:` or `-`)
- Detection directories
- Placeholder support (e.g., `$ARGUMENTS`, `{{args}}`)
- Special adapter requirements (TOML, doc-injection)
- Global vs project-local paths

### Configuration Schema

```json
{
  "name": "newtool",
  "displayName": "New Tool",
  "directory": ".newtool/rules",
  "filenamePattern": "clavix-{name}",
  "extension": ".md",
  "separator": "-",
  "detection": ".newtool",
  "placeholder": "$ARGUMENTS",
  "global": false,
  "specialAdapter": null
}
```

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Internal adapter name (kebab-case) |
| `displayName` | Yes | User-facing name |
| `directory` | Yes | Command file directory (use `~/` for global) |
| `filenamePattern` | Yes | Pattern with `{name}` placeholder |
| `extension` | Yes | `.md` or `.toml` |
| `separator` | Yes | `:` (TOML/folderized) or `-` (flat markdown) |
| `detection` | Yes | Directory to detect integration presence |
| `placeholder` | No | Argument placeholder (`$ARGUMENTS`, `{{args}}`, etc.) |
| `global` | No | If `true`, writes to home directory |
| `specialAdapter` | No | `"toml"` or `"doc-injection"` for custom handling |

---

## Adding New Adapters

To add support for a new AI tool:

### Simple Adapter (Config-Driven)

Add to `src/config/integrations.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "newtool",
  "displayName": "New Tool",
  "directory": ".newtool/rules",
  "filenamePattern": "clavix-{name}",
  "extension": ".md",
  "separator": "-",
  "detection": ".newtool"
}
```

That's it! The adapter registry loads configurations from this JSON file automatically. No TypeScript changes needed for simple adapters.

### Special Adapter (Custom Logic)

If the tool needs special handling (TOML format, doc injection, etc.):

1. Add entry to `src/config/integrations.json` with `specialAdapter` field
2. Create `src/core/adapters/newtool-adapter.ts`
3. Extend `BaseAdapter` or `TomlFormattingAdapter`
4. Register in `AgentManager` constructor
5. Add tests in `tests/adapters/`
6. Update `docs/integrations.md` tables
